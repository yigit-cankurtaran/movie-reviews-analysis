# Movie Review Sentiment Analysis

- In this project we will be using the built-in movie review dataset from NLTK to train a Naive Bayes Classifier to predict the sentiment of a movie review.

- The model was huge. I trained it on Colab and it took over 20 minutes to train. But I'm very satisfied with the results. This is the first time I've trained a model on a dataset this big and getting over 80% accuracy was motivating.
