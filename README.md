# Movie Review Sentiment Analysis

- In this project we will be using the IMDB dataset to train a model to predict the sentiment of a movie review. The dataset contains 50,000 movie reviews from IMDB, labeled by sentiment (positive/negative). Reviews have been preprocessed, and each review is encoded as a sequence of word indexes (integers). For convenience, the words are indexed by overall frequency in the dataset, so that for instance the integer "3" encodes the 3rd most frequent word in the data.
